1) Cut / Copy all lines containing a pattern
:g/toto/d A
Use the "global" command
:g/pattern/command

- Cut lines containing pattern toto and add them to register a:
:g/toto/d A
then paste where you want:
"ap

- To copy them instead:
:g/toto/c A

- Isolate lines based on a pattern in a new buffer

:w
:vimgrep /pattern/ %
:copen

2) Search your pattern: /toto

Make your modif: delete, change or whatever
Go to next occurent: n
Repeat last action: .

3) Using gn
Search your pattern: /toto
Using gn will search and select the first occurence you want to modify
gn can be prefixed by a command, for example 'c' to change, or 'd' to delete, or gU to uppercase 

Examples:
- Remove some  patterns toto from the file:
/toto
dgn (remove the first occurence)
. (remove the second)
n (skip the next one, the third)
. (remove the third)

- Change some patterns toto from the file:
/toto
cgn (then insert your new value, so first occurence changed)
. (repeat action on next occurence)
n (skip next occurent)
. (repeat action on next occurence)

- Uppercase some patterns:
Same mechanism than previous examples, juste use gUgn instead
